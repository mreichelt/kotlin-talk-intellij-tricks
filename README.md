[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mreichelt/kotlin-talk-intellij-tricks.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.org/mreichelt/kotlin-talk-intellij-tricks)

Kotlin's power is coming not only by its syntax, but also by its awesome IDE integration. IntelliJ is full of great
helpers and shortcuts that makes us more productive - and has some extras that make Kotlin development even better!

This talk is done completely in IntelliJ IDEA - just open up this project there and follow along the samples yourself! ðŸ™Œ
